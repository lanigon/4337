# Skill Hub

**Skill Hub** is a curated collection of plug-and-play AI skills bundled with Bitget Agent Hub. Each skill is a structured prompt that instructs Claude Code (or any compatible AI) how to use the market-data MCP server to answer a specific category of questions — turning raw API calls into coherent, analyst-grade outputs.

Skills live in `packages/bitget-skill-hub/skills/`, one subdirectory per skill, with a standard `SKILL.md` entry point.

## What Is a Skill?

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file with a YAML front matter `description` (used for trigger matching) and a body that defines:

- **What data to fetch** — which MCP tools to call and in what order
- **How to interpret it** — signal thresholds, frameworks, decision trees
- **How to present it** — output templates with consistent formatting
- **Error handling** — neutral language when data is unavailable

Skills are self-contained. Install with `npm install -g bitget-skill-hub` and they activate automatically in Claude Code.

## Using Skills Together

The five skills are designed to complement each other for a complete market picture:

| Question type | Skills to combine |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Full market assessment | `macro-analyst` + `sentiment-analyst` + `technical-analysis` |
| Is now a good time to buy BTC? | `market-intel` (cycle position) + `sentiment-analyst` (positioning) + `technical-analysis` (entry levels) |
| What's moving markets today? | `news-briefing` + `macro-analyst` |
| Is this altcoin worth looking at? | `market-intel` (DEX/on-chain) + `technical-analysis` (TA) + `sentiment-analyst` (crowd positioning) |

## Required MCP Server

Most skills depend on the **market-data MCP server** (`https://datahub.noxiaohao.com/mcp`) for live data. Configure it in your Claude Code MCP settings before using these skills.

The server provides: `crypto_market`, `defi_analytics`, `dex_market`, `sentiment_index`, `derivatives_sentiment`, `news_feed`, `social_trending`, `tradfi_news`, `network_status`, `rates_yields`, `macro_indicators`, `cross_asset`, `global_assets`, `global_data`, `cn_market`.

> **Note:** The `technical-analysis` skill does **not** use the MCP server. It fetches kline data directly from the Bitget API and runs indicator calculations locally in Python. Requires `pip install pandas numpy`.
